#### Added
- **Tag-less review support** - NEW: Use direct area IDs instead of requiring tags

- **Enhanced CLI** - Click framework replacing argparse for better UX

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Python version now 3.13+

  - Tag-based: `{"search_tag": "Work", "save_area": "ID"}`
  - Area-based: `{"area_ids": ["ID1", "ID2"], "save_area": "ID"}`
- **Installation method** - Now uses `uv` for automatic dependency management
- **File structure** - Tests moved to `tests/` folder
